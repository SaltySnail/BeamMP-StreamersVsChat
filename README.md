# BeamMP-StreamersVsChat
Let your twitch chat wreak havoc on your server.

skip to the linux part if you are using that.

To make this work you'll need to change some stuff:
- First you need to get your twitch API key (for example [here](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/)). Put the API key (including 'oauth:') into a file named 'DONTOPENMEWHILELIVE.oauth' (create a file with that exact name). 
- Open `Server/StreamersVsChat/StreamersVsChat.py` and replace everything that says "Julianstap" (my twitch) with your twitch username. Easiest way to do this is have Visual Studio Code (vscode), open the .workspace file, press ctrl+f and search for Julianstap and replace all with your username.
- Replace BEAMMP_SERVER_EXE_FOLDER with the folder where your *BeamMP-Server.exe* is located.
  
*Windows*:
- Open .vscode/tasks.json and replace everything that has 'C:/Users/Julian/Desktop/beammp_Server/windows' with the folder where your *BeamMP-Server.exe* is located.
- Inside '*BeamMP-Server.exe Location*/Resources/Server/' create a folder named StreamersVsChat.
- In vscode right click folder explorer on the left and press Open in integrated terminal and type `pip3 install ahk`

*Linux*:
- Download the latest release.
- unzip the release to your `<beammp_server_executable>/Resources/` folder (`unzip StreamersVsChat.zip && cp -r Server <beammp_server_executable>/Resources/Server && cp -r Client <beammp_server_executable>/Resources/Client`). Anything in between "<>" should be replaced by your directory path.
- Do the same first four steps (with your preferred text editor or IDE).
- Run `pip3 install ahk`
- Now you can start it with: `python3 <beammp_server_executable>/Resources/Server/StreamersVsChat/StreamersVsChat.py`

After all these changes press 'ctrl+shift+p' and run the tasks 'Copy server' and 'Compress client'. Next right click on 'StreamersVsChat.py' and click 'Run Python File in Terminal'. It will print out all available twitch chat commands in the terminal.

If you want have the commands only apply on you, change BEAMMP_NAME to your beammp username.


Now you are ready to start the server and receive commands from the twitch chat (you can test this without streaming).
